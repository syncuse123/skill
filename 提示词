Analyze the uploaded system architecture diagram image.



1. Identify and extract all components, layers, boundaries, and relationships.

2. Preserve the original system semantics and component naming.



Then recreate the diagram as a clean, professional SVG with:

- clear layered layout (top-down or left-to-right)

- grouped components by function

- consistent spacing and alignment

- labeled components and arrows

- enterprise technical diagram style


Output requirements:

- SVG format only

- fully vector-based, no raster images

- editable text (not converted to paths)

- simple geometric shapes and arrows

- white background

- suitable for technical documentation and PPT
